This is my (supervoltage) guitar tuner program. It uses SFML to generate 
the sine wave.

Lots of thanks to Naelstrof for helping me out!

"guiner" in the master branch is the Linux executable. The source code is there
for documentation purposes. I should add some comments sometime, to not make it
seem too daunting. It was daunting for me anyway.
